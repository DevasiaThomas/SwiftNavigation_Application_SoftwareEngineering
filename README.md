# SwiftNavigation_Application_SoftwareEngineering
As a requirement to my application to Swift Nav.<br>Test suite files are suffixed with _test.go<br>
use go run main.go and provide as input the number of terms you want.<br>
use go test -v to run tests for each package.<br>
I would have implemented the test for the main package as well but for some reason(I still have to research it) running os/exec.cmd() magically deletes my go.exe file...  And I was like .... dafuq?
